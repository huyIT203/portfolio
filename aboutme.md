I’m a Flutter Mobile Developer who enjoys building practical and user-friendly mobile applications.

I focus on Flutter and Dart, working with BLoC state management and clean architecture to create scalable and maintainable apps. I have experience integrating REST APIs, handling authentication with JWT (access & refresh tokens), and implementing social login such as Google and Facebook.

Through personal projects like Outfit Planner, I’ve worked on real-world features including onboarding flows, calendar-based OOTD, image handling, and secure data storage. I also have a backend background, which helps me understand API design and collaborate effectively with backend systems.

I’m currently looking for a Flutter Junior/Fresher position where I can grow my skills, learn from experienced developers, and contribute to real products.
